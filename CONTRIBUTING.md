# Welcome

Hi there, thanks for visiting and for reading about contributing to this project; I'm honestly over-the-moon you are here.

Right now (May 2018), I'm not quite ready to take on much real-time management of this project as one with multiple contributors, but I am getting to that point very soon. If you'd like to collaborate on ideas, directions or proposals for the direction of this project, the components it contains, or anything else, please reach out to me directly at [ben@benjaminlistwon.com](mailto:ben@benjaminlistwon.com) or [open an issue](https://github.com/BenjaminListwon/vuejs-inclusive-components/issues).

Thanks, and I promise I'll get back to this doc very soon.
